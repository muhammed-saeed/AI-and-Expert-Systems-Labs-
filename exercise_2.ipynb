Many frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow, Caffe) allow easy usage of deep neural networks without precise knowledge of the inner workings of backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms. While these are very useful tools, it is important to get a good understanding of how to implement basic network training from scratch before using these libraries to speed up the process. For this purpose, we will implement a simple two-layer neural network and its training algorithm based on back-propagation using only basic matrix operations in questions 1 to 3. In question 4, we will use a popular deep learning library, PyTorch, to do the same and understand the advantages offered by using such tools.\n",

In this final question we will use the PyTorch library to implement the same two-layer network we did before and train it on the Cifar-10 dataset. However, extending a two-layer network to a three or four layered one is a matter of changing two-three lines of code using PyTorch.
